Reactor Physics Benchmark Models
================================

This repository contains a collection of benchmark models for the OpenMC and
other Monte Carlo particle transport codes. The following benchmark models are
currently available:

icsbep 
  Problems from the `International Handbook of Evaluated Criticality Safety
  Benchmark Experiments`_.

indc-usa-107
  Simple pin-cell model to test S(a,b) treatment in Monte Carlo codes. See
  `INDC(USA)-107`_.

mc-performance
  The `Monte Carlo Performance Benchmark`_ originally proposed by J. Eduard
  Hoogenboom and William Martin.

opr
  A BOL model of a Optimized Power Reactor 1000 (OPR1000) from South Korea. See
  Lee M.J. et al., "Monte Carlo Reactor Calculation with Substantially Reduced
  Number of Cycles", *Proceedings of PHYSOR 2012*, Knoxville, TN (2012).

source-convergence
  The `OECD/NEA Source Convergence Benchmarks`_ which include a checkboard
  storage of assemblies, a pincell array with irradiated fuel, three thick
  one-dimensional slabs, and an array of interacting spheres.
